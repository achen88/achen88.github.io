Too Long; Didn't Watch (TL;DW) is a web app that turns Youtube videos into short, funny gifs. Has your friend or kid ever sent you a video that you just didn't have time to watch? Too cool for lecture? TL;DW will save the day!

I built this with Jerry Yu and Hari Subbaraj for HackMIT 2018, and won Best Use of GIPHY API.

TL;DW works by first downloading a youtube video, and feeding the audio to RevSpeech API for transcription. Then, we do natural langauge processing by performing "part of speech" tagging and frequency analysis to identify the key words and ideas from the video title and transcription. These are pooled to select and display gifs from the GIPHY API. We used React/Redux, Flask, RevSpeech, Giphy, and NLTK.
